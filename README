Build instructions:

Edit the top-level Makefile, and uncomment the appropriate export
lines for OUT, TARGET, and LIBS, then run ``make''.

Note that the AAlib version does not use the same keys as other
versions. Here is the current mapping:
	AAlib		Others
	  q		Escape
	  w		Up
	  a		Left
	  s		Down
	  d		Right
	  '		Enter
