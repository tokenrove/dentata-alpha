BUGS (things that don't behave the way they should)

(air/*) 16BPP support is broken, particularly alpha handling, and SVGAlib
(flash) superior PCX support
(flash) more PNM support


WARTS/VAPOR (things that are ugly, or things that haven't been done and
             should be finished)

Documentation
Error checking, status, handling
(air/*, flash, ...) 24BPP support
(flash) TGA support
(metal) Better handling of multiple device support. (clean interface to
	keyboard, mouse, joystick, controller, et cetera)
(metal) more robust DOS keyboard handler
(quick) more accurate DOS timer
(quick) select on empty list instead of usleep for portability
(crash) support for more complex format specifiers
(wood) better playfield collision handling
(bubble) possible removal of ray collision check, or optimization with
	algorithm from Graphics Gems
(bubble) gencolliderect code should go on a pixel-by-pixel basis
(heat) more box styles
stage2 design
(wood) plane handles, like bubble's sprite handles
(bubble) saner sprite handle support, without as much memory wastage


WISHLIST (bells and whistles, or things which we aren't sure are necessary
	  or even good)

(drwily) Optimized blits
Option to premultiply alphas in blits
Tilemap browser
Sprite browser
(air) vanilla X11 support
(flash) Improved closestcolor algorithms?
(flash) PNG support
(flash) TIFF support
(metal) mouse support
(crash) bounding box, word wrap support?
(crash) multicolor fonts?
(crash) deal with newlines?
(wood) potential optimizations wrt layer recalculations on pan, incremental
	updates
(heat) sprite trails
(heat) high-alpha overlays
(heat) geometric transitions
(heat) complex (ff-like) screen blur/fade effects
(heat) star field
(heat) fire effects
(heat) shared effects buffer optimization
